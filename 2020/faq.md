## Frequently Asked Questions:
<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will EGSR 2020 be held this year?</i></p>

<p>Yes! We are planning on a full EGSR 2020 program, including research and industry papers as well as keynotes.</p>

<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will the submission deadline be extended because of COVID-19?</i></p>

<p>No. All deadlines remain the same as they were originally set in the EGSR 2020 CFP.</p>

<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will there be support for remote presentation of papers?</i></p>

<p>All accepted papers must have at least one author registered for the conference to present the paper. In the event that the presenting author is unable or unwilling to attend in person, we will provide a mechanism for remote presentation of the talk.</p>

<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will it be possible to attend the conference remotely?</i></p>

<p>We hope to be able to hold a regular in-person EGSR this year, but are preparing for alternative conference formats, including both partially- and fully- virtual, depending on how the situation unfolds. We have not yet made a final decision about the conference format.</p>
