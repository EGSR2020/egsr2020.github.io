<p><i>Due to the developing COVID-19 situation, we have pushed back the research papers abstract deadline to Monday April 13 and the paper submission deadline to April 17.<br>
Furthermore, this yearâ€™s EGSR will take place completely virtually. We are currently evaluating available options for remote attendance and the format and details for this are still being worked out. Authors of accepted papers this year will be asked to present their work remotely. We encourage authors to submit work to EGSR despite the altered circumstances of a virtual EGSR meeting.</i></p>
Please see the <a href="/faq">EGSR 2020 FAQ</a> for more information about COVID-19 and changes to the conference this year.

## Eurographics Symposium on Rendering
 The 31st edition of Eurographics Symposium on Rendering returns once again (after 19 years!) to London, and will be held from June 30th to July 2nd, 2020. The main venue for EGSR 2020 is the South Kensington campus of Imperial College London (right next to multiple Museums, Royal Albert Hall, and Hyde Park), and it will be jointly organized by the <a href='https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rgi/'>Realistic Graphics and Imaging group</a> at Imperial College and the <a href='http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/'>Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics group</a> at University College London (UCL). As part of the joint organization, an evening social event will be hosted at UCL on June 30th. EGSR will be preceded by the 8th annual Workshop on Material Appearance Modeling (MAM) on June 29th. We look forward to welcoming you to London!
