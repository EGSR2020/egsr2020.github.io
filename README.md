# EGSR Website

This website was developped for the EGSR 2020 edition, which happened virtually from June 30th to July 3rd 2020. It is partially year specific and could be used to create a 2021 version while preserving the 2020 version with a little clean up.

It is based on a fork of the CVMP website (https://github.com/cvmp/cvmp.github.io) and adapted to suit the online format.
